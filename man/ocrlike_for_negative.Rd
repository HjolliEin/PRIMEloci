\title{Generate OCR-like Negative Samples}
\usage{
ocrlike_for_negative(orig_ctss, ocr_gr, dis)
}
\arguments{
\item{orig_ctss}{A CAGE dataset containing the original CTSS information.}

\item{ocr_gr}{A `GRanges` object representing positive OCR regions.}

\item{dis}{A numeric value specifying the distance to extend from the center
of the TCs.}
}
\value{
A `GRanges` object containing the OCR-like negative samples.
}
\description{
This function generates OCR-like negative samples
by identifying transcription clusters (TCs)
from CAGE data that do not overlap with positive OCR regions.
The identified TCs are extended from their center points based on the "thick"
positions. The negative samples can overlap with positive regions after
extension, but the original TCs will not overlap with positive OCR regions.

\examples{
# Example usage:
# Assuming `orig_ctss` is a CAGE dataset and
`ocr_gr` is a GRanges object for OCR
negative_samples <- ocrlike_for_negative(orig_ctss, ocr_gr, dis = 100)
}
