\title{Import DHS Data from ENCODE}
\usage{
import_dhs_encode(dhs_paths_with_names)
}
\arguments{
\item{dhs_paths_with_names}{A file path or a vector of file paths to the DHS 
data files.}
}
\value{
A list of data frames, each containing the DHS data from one file.
}
\description{
This function reads DHS data from specified file paths, assuming the files 
are tab-delimited with columns "seqnames", "start", "end", and "name". It 
converts the start positions from 0-based to 1-based indexing and returns a 
list of data frames, each representing one file.
}
\examples{
# Example usage:
# Single file path:
# dhs_path <- "path/to/file1.txt"
# result <- import_dhs_encode(dhs_path)
#
# Multiple file paths:
# dhs_paths <- c("path/to/file1.txt", "path/to/file2.txt")
# result <- import_dhs_encode(dhs_paths)
